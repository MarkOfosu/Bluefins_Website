         <h1>Code of Ethics</h1>
         <p>
            Swimmers will not be mean/disrespectful to each other, use inappropriate words, or challenge coaches during training sessions. Swimmers will not be late to practice - if this is unavoidable, swimmers must walk as brisk as possible to the pool. All swimmers must have drinking water during training sessions.

            Parents will not interrupt or interfere with children or the coaches during training sessions. Parents will not act as the coaches to their children.

            All concerns can be addressed to the head coach privately.
